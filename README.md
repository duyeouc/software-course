Records of software engineering course.<br>
My course teacher is *GaoFeng*, whose github address is https://github.com/summitgao/SoftwareClass.

The folder <b>'course-record'</b> is the record file of the course experiment per week, which is written in *markdown* grammar.
And each **'md'** file records the weekly work content, steps and problems encountered.
